## Overview

The Stonk Master is a Discord bot for fellow apes to monitor stonks without leaving their gaming habitat. It presents information about stonks in a very easy and simple way.

## Installation

The installation is only tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, however other operating systems should also work without any problem. Just make sure that all dependencies are completly installed.

Make sure Python 3.8 or higher, pip and setuptools are installed on your system.

```{bash}
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
```

Now clone the repository.

```{bash}
$ git clone git@github.com:d-stoll/stonkmaster.git
$ cd stonkmaster
```

And install all dependencies and the executable.

```{bash}
$ pip install .
```

(Optional) You can create your own configuration file to customize emotes and texts.

```{bash}
$ cp default.ini custom.ini
$ vim custom.ini
```

To run the bot, obtain you personal discord token and run the stonkmaster executable (with your own configuration if you created one).

```{bash}
$ export DISCORD_TOKEN=<YOUR_PERSONAL_DISCORD_TOKEN>
$ stonkmaster --config custom.ini
```

## Features

The main functionality of the bot is to query data from financial APIs and make it quickly accessible to users via a simple interface. For this purpose, we have developed a collection of commands that you can use.

### Commands

- `$price [ticker]` -> Shows the current price of the stonk, as well as its daily change.
- `$shorts [ticker]` -> Provides currently known information on how heavily the stonk is shorted.
- `$chart [ticker] [range]` -> Generates a chart showing the price development of the ticker over. The range can be specified in days (d), months (m) or years (y).
- `$sec [ticker] [filing-type]` -> Fetches the latest SEC company filings from EDGAR.
- `$watch [ticker]` -> Displays the price and change of a ticker in the bot status.

This list of commands is continuously being expanded. If you find bugs or want to suggest improvements, do not hesitate to make a pull request.
